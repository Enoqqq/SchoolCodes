String numDigit = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Welcome to our program! Please enter a
number (less than or equal to three digits) into the text box!"); // this creates a dialog box with
the user able to enter a value and then assigns that value to a variable called “numDigit” which
is of the data type String.
completeNum = Integer.parseInt(numDigit); // this converts the string to a number so we can
do some calculations on it!
// note → we cannot go straight from the showInputDialog and assign it a variable of a type int
or double, we need to do it in two steps!
