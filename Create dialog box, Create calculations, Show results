Step 11 - create the first dialog box
String numDigit = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Welcome to our program! Please enter a
number (less than or equal to three digits) into the text box!"); // this creates a dialog box with
the user able to enter a value and then assigns that value to a variable called “numDigit” which
is of the data type String.
completeNum = Integer.parseInt(numDigit); // this converts the string to a number so we can
do some calculations on it!
// note → we cannot go straight from the showInputDialog and assign it a variable of a type int
or double, we need to do it in two steps!
Step 12 - Create some calculations on the first input dialog box entry
Now that we have “completeNum” as a number, we can do some calculations
For example
hundreds = completeNum/100;
tens = (completeNum-hundreds*100)/10;
etc.
Step 13 - Show the results to the user
//create a message dialog box so the calculations can be displayed to the user
JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Value of ones = " + ones + "\nValue of
tens = " + tens + "\nValue of hundreds = " + hundreds + "\n The sum of the
digits is " + sum);
DecimalFormat twoDigit = new DecimalFormat("#,##0.00"); // this isn't really
necessary for this assignment, but I wanted to show how you to format numbers
